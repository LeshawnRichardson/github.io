		<h1>Hello, I'm Leshawn Richardson</h2>
		<h3> Welcome, nice to virtually meet you!</h3>


		<p> Presently, I am on a professional journey as an aspiring software engineer. I am completing a programming intensive course through Perscholar expanding my knowledge in the field daily. Prior, and most recent work experience includes Microsoft , YMCA Information Technology Department and Baylor Scott & White Healthcare where I held several positions over 10 plus years. During my time at Baylor I completed a B.A. in Management Information System at the rise of Covid- 19 which impacted by career at the time. This lead me to pursue two of my true passions a career in coding and balancing motherhood. Outside work I love spending time with my kids Amir and Ella.
